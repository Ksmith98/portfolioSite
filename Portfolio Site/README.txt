For easier integratration of animations, as well as seamless transitions and interactivity,
I decided to use Bootstrap as a major "jumping off point" for my site. It allowed me to 
have a strong base to format my data with, and customizability that I was looking for, all 
without me having to create each and every javascript or css string.

My work has given me some hiccups in uploading, and this is something I plan to further work
on and format as I add more and more.
